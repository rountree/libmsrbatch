Add "add_writeops_to_batch()".  Or maybe we don't need the singular form?
    Maybe a better name is add_[read|write]op_to_cpu() and add_[read|write]op_to_cpus()?

print_approved_list() looks like it will fail if check_msr() isn't called first.
    Ditto for msr_read_check() and msr_write_check().  If msr_list is NULL, those
    functions should call msr_check on their own to initialize the list rather than
    failing.

Should print_op() be extern?  If you're only using the function within the library
    then (if the library only takes up one file) mark the function static and put
    the function declaration at the top of the C file.  Putting the function in the
    header means that you expect the end user to make use of the function, and I
    don't think you're exposing ops to the user.
